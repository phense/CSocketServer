CSocketServer
=============

A simple example passing variables from php to c using sockets.

This code is part of a larger program which will fetch color-values from an HTML5/JQuery App and pass them
to a arduino board to control LED colors.
However, this part only demonstrates the basics of socket communication between a PHP File and a C-Program.
If you have any suggestions for the server, please feel free to share.
